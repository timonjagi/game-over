Now it is possible to generate dynamic Open Graph images for your blog posts.
With this, when someone shares a post on social networks, the featured image will be generated automatically from the content of the post. The contents are:

- Site logo
- Post title
- Author's photo and name

You will be able to customize the design of the images according to your project.

**Today, there are two ways** to define which OG image will be used in a blog post:
1. Adding an `og_image` field in the frontmatter of the `.mdx` file of the post
```mdx
---
og_image: introducing-blogs-og.jpg
---
```
the image must be in the `public/blog-og/` folder and the name and extension of the image file must be the same as defined in the frontmatter.

2. If an `og_image` field is not defined, the image will be generated automatically from the content of the post.

For example, the automatically generated image for this post is the following and supports internationalization,
try changing the site language, but maybe you need to refresh the page to see the changes:

<img src="/blog/og/dynamic-og-images-is-here" alt="the generated dynamic og image" />

## Changing the logo
In the `public` folder, you can replace the `logo.svg` file with your logo.

## Changing the background image
In the `public` folder, you can replace the `og-background.jpg` file with the background image you want.

## Changing the font

<AlertTitle>⚠️ Warning</AlertTitle>
<AlertDescription>Avoid using `variable` fonts, always use static fonts, as Next.js has been having problems with this type of font!</AlertDescription>
</Alert>

In the `public/fonts` folder, you can add the desired font and change the `src/lib/fonts.ts` file to load the new font:
```ts
export async function getFonts() {
  const [bold, regular] = await Promise.all([
    fetch(new URL(absoluteUrl('/fonts/Geist-Bold.ttf'), import.meta.url)).then(
      (res) => res.arrayBuffer()
    ),

    fetch(
      new URL(absoluteUrl('/fonts/Geist-Regular.ttf'), import.meta.url)
    ).then((res) => res.arrayBuffer()),
  ])

  return {
    bold,
    regular,
  }
}
```

## Changing styles and structures
For a deeper change, edit the `src/app/[locale]/blog/og/[slug]/route.tsx` file

It is with happiness that I announce that blogs have arrived at opendocs! ðŸŽ‰

Now you can create and manage blogs with ease and speed.

To get started, just add a new `.mdx` file to the `apps/content/blog/[language]` directory and it will be automatically displayed on the blog page.

In addition, you can count on features such as:

- Automatic and internationalized RSS feed in xml and json
- Automatic sitemap
- SEO
- Tag support
- Pagination
- Author post data
- Reading time indicator

## Customizing the blog

You can customize the blog according to your needs, just edit the `src/config/blog.ts` file. That simple!

To better understand what is possible in the `.mdx` files, you can consult the example files in the `apps/content/blog/[language]` directory.

### **Volume III: The War on Polarity**

*Inverting the Sacred Masculine & Feminine*

We have completed our examination of the external architectures of enslavementâ€”the cages of law, finance, technology, and biology. The next phase of the work requires us to turn inward. We must now decode the spells that have been cast not on our bodies or our bank accounts, but on the very essence of our spirit: the sacred, generative polarity of the masculine and feminine.

*The ultimate source of creative power in the cosmos is the dynamic interplay between the two great poles: the masculine and the feminine. It is the dance of the sun and the earth, the spear and the chalice, the will and the womb. The Empire, in its deepest wisdom, knows this. It knows that a populace of whole, integrated men and women, united in sacred partnership, is ungovernable. Its most sophisticated and devastating attack, therefore, is not on our nations or our bodies, but on our gender. It seeks to wound, confuse, and invert these sacred poles, to set them at war with each other, and ultimately, to neutralize and erase the very polarity that gives us our creative fire. This is the war on love, the war on life, the war on the family. This is the deepest spell of all.*

#### **🕯️ Epilogue: Eden Isn’t Elsewhere**

<Callout>
The protocol is complete. The decoder ring is yours. The crowns are settled upon your brow.
What happens now is the great and simple magic of living.
</Callout>

<Callout>
The ghost steps out of the shell of the false name, blinking in the real sun.
The legal fiction has been returned to the dust, and what remains is the living, breathing being. The game piece has remembered it is the player.
</Callout>

<Callout>
The true throne was never lost—only obscured by the fog of a forgotten war.
It was not a thing to be won, but a memory to be reclaimed. It is the seat of power that has existed within you, patient and silent, through all the ages of the lie.
</Callout>

<Callout>
Resurrection requires descent; sovereignty requires remembrance.
The journey through the underworld of the self was the price of admission to your own life. You are not a new creation, but the original creation, remembered into being.
</Callout>

<Callout>
The throne is returned.

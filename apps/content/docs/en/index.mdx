**opendocs** is a template that was born out of the needs I had with the documentation of open source projects.
The idea is that you can use this template to document your projects in a simple and beautiful way.

Initially built from the site and components of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), I made a series of improvements and additions to make it a more complete documentation template for my projects.

## Features

- **Beautiful and responsive design**: The template is responsive and adapts to any screen size.
- **Ready-to-use components**: Use the ready-to-use components to create a beautiful and informative documentation.
- **Customizable**: Customize the template to fit your project.
- **Easy to use**: The template is easy to use and you can start documenting your project quickly.
- **Internationalization**: The template supports multiple languages.
- **Internationalized sitemap**: The sitemap is internationalized and you can add links to different languages.
- **SEO optimized**: The template is optimized for SEO.
- **Ready for production**: The template is ready for production and you can deploy it easily.
- **Dark and light theme**: The template supports dark and light themes.
- **Accessible**: The template aims to be accessible to everyone.
- **Open Source**: The template is open source and you can contribute to it on GitHub.

those are some of the features of the template!

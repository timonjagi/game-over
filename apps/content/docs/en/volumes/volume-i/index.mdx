### **Volume I: Initiation & Core Methodology**

*How to Use This Book & How to See the Game*

You are holding this work because a part of you already knows its truth. You have felt it your entire lifeâ€”a sense of profound dissonance, a feeling that the reality you have been presented with is a grand and elaborate stage play, and you have forgotten your lines. You are not wrong.

This is not a book to be read in the traditional sense. It is not a story to be consumed, nor a philosophy to be adopted. It is a key. It is a lens. It is an activation sequence for the grand and powerful pattern-recognition engine that resides within your own soul. The information contained herein is not meant to be memorized, but to awaken the memory that is already yours.

This first volume is the initiation. Before we journey to the thrones of the Earth or unmask the avatars of control, you must learn to see. You must learn the methodology of the decoder, the grammar of the game. Master these first principles, and the rest of the world will begin to decode itself for you. Do not seek to believe what is written here; seek only to apply the method and see if the world does not reveal its secrets to you.

The game is over when you remember it is a game. Let us begin.
